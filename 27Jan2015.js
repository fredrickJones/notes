// getting started with angular on pluralsite

// when you are refactoring look for the little components that are hiding in larger components

// views are not good canadites for directives

// everything we do needs to be small and consise
  // espacially directives

// camel case in the code and snake case in html
// directives should always have at least one dash '-' so do whatever you have to get two words in there
  // make it easier to read and makes it so it wont possibly break in the future as html changes
