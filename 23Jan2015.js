//AngularJS Review


//module.controller
//module.directive
//module.service
//module.filter


//CONTROLLERS
  //the controller mediates between the data(services) & the view(html)
  //the two most important things within coding
    //MODULARITY
  	//DONT DUPLICATE
 //populates the scope

//SERVICES
  //the controller brings services into play
  //inject services into the controller function
  //anything that starts with the '$' is a built in Angular services
  //custom services are just injected into the controller by name of service
  //their job is to be your 'business logic'
    //doing something to data, with data 
    //complex coding should not be done in the controller but instead in the service
  //put the logic in the right place and save yourself hours and hours of change.

//DIRECTIVES
  //modularize view functionality

//FILTERS

//CODE SMELL
  //when something seems a bit off and you need to rethink how you are doing it
  //i.e. number of parameters reaching 6-7;


//COMMENTS ARE BAD
  //a CODE SMELL or failures to craft your code correctly
  //its okay now but stop using them soon
  //

//your career will be 30% education


//for 99.9% of projects a single module will work


//ways to figure out where your code broke
  //hard code
    //this isolates the input of the different moving parts

  //console.log
    //this isolates the output of the different moving parts


//JavaScript is actually called ECMAScript
  //the next release is now ECMAScript2015 not ES6.


//for promises
  //invoke the function
    //itunes.getData().then(success, failure)


//premature optimization is the route to bad coding
